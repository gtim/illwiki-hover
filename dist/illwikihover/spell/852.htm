This will spread dominion to the places where false pretenders were worshiped. When a forest has the right dominion it will start to attack instead of whispering hymns. Enemies in that province or neighboring provinces will be attacked by creatures of the awakening forest.</div>		<div class="overlay-details pane-extension">All forests under neutral or enemy dominion act as if they were temples of the caster's pretender. When the dominion has become friendly it stops spreading. Forests with friendly dominion will spontaneously spawn attacks from forest beings in the province or its neighbors if controlled by an enemy. A strong dominion or high Growth scale helps the effectiveness of the attacks and Wastelands are never attacked by the forest creatures.</div>	</div>
