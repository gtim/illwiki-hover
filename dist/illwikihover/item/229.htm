In front of the breastplate are two bronze arms ending in handles. These handles are connected with wires to the wings. The handles are held by the bearer, who vigorously pumps them, thus gaining the ability to fly. The whole device is heavily enchanted with the raw power of Earth, which lends the bearer the strength required to use the device. Unfortunately, the manner of its construction and its enormous bulk will make it difficult to wield weapons. On the upside, a flying bearer landing among his enemy with furiously beating wings will scatter them like so many leaves in a storm. The sound of the copper feathers grating against each other will also make a horrible thundering noise that will cause panic in enemy ranks.</div>	</div>
