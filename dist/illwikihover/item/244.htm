After Vanlade the Vanadrott slew Uffga, he flayed the ancient troll and inscribed Uffga's skin with runes and blessings of Blood magic that preserved in it the character of its original owner. Vanlade, who was already a wise and ancient Van, had not become old through incaution, so he gave the skin of the querulous old troll to one of his favored einheres and it was with only mild surprise that he found Uffga's quarrelsome stubbornness eventually dominating the will of the einhere. In time the skinsuit almost subsumed the personality of the einhere and his body turned into that of a troll, though one of lesser stature and power. Vanlade was forced to slay this diminished Uffga again and wisely decided to pass its skin on to followers who would not have to spend time in his vicinity, lest Uffga once more try to work his vengeance on Vanlade through his remains.</div>	</div>
