While projected, the caster will only be able to sense and affect magic, but this still makes it possible to search for magic sites and enemy mages. The caster will be able to project himself into all provinces that have a friendly Dominion.

Magic sites are more elusive when searching in this way and a very powerful mage is required to find those that are well hidden. Mages are usually able to stay hidden from the projected mind if they have a good magic resistance value. If an Astral mage is found, a battle of the minds will ensue. Only one will leave it with their mind intact. Non-astral mages cannot try to retaliate, but neither do they risk losing their sanity in the process. However, they will be subjected to a minor Mind Burn attack if they are found. If the caster becomes feebleminded the enchantment will dissipate.</div>		<div class="overlay-details pane-extension">Mind Burn: 10 AN dmg (MR negates), penetration bonuses makes the MR test harder.</div>	</div>
