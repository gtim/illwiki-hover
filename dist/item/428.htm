The crown is made from the finest gold and set with the very best gems. In fact the crown is so perfect that all the great smiths claim that only one of their lineage could have made something this great. Some say it was crafted by the gods and some say the Pantokrator conquered it in a fight on another plane. Its true origin is unknown, but wise mages say that its construction has been heavily influenced by horrors and that only the wisest of the wise would be able to wear this crown without being destroyed.</div>	</div>
