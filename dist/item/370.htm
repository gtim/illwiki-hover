He was made by an unknown craftsman long ago and has since shown up in various battles throughout the ages. Percival looks much like any knight, except that he is made out of tin. He also behaves much like an ordinary knight, except that he lives in a pocket. When the horns of battle call, Percival will charge out of his owner's pocket, land on the ground, grow to full size and deliver fierce battle to the enemy. Percival's main diet is lint, with an occasional shot of tin polish.</div>	</div>
