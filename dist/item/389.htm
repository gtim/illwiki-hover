Even though he was little, he was large in his faith and prayed every day to become larger so he could punish the large people who were often cruel to him. One day his God was in a good mood and gave him an amulet that enabled him to take revenge upon the people in his village. Gustafus was killed by a mob shortly after he had killed a substantial number of the villagers.</div>	</div>
